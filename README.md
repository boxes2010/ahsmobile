Arcadia High Mobile
Dear new programmers,
This is the iOS version of AHS Mobile written in Swift. If you're studying this to get a feel for the language or to understand how I programmed this app, please be mindful that the code isn't nearly as readable as I wanted it to be and I apologize for that. There will be some unused source files, but hopefully it's clear which ones are useful. Also, this program is for the most part outdated because Swift updates very frequently and I haven't fixed all the bugs that comes with the newer Swift versions. However, there are still many things that are similar so reading the code will give you insight on Swift's cool features.

You will see some podfiles (such as the library for Firebase) that I obviously didn't program but rather installed using CocoaPods. This means that you will eventually program in the .xcworkspace file, not the .xcodeproj file, but don't worry about that until you start implementing remote notifications.

Just some advice, when you guys are programming the next version try to do these things, it will save you a lot of time
- Make interfaces and have each programmer implement them
- Make your code readable unlike mine 
- Don't use storyboard unless if it's for super simple pages
- Use data structures that Swift provides you
- Stackoverflow and Google everything

Good luck! I hope you guys learn a lot about programming from this experience.
- Jason
